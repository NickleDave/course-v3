# Other resources for learning about neural networks

## Neural networks and Deep Learning
<http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/>
on-line book by Michael Nielsen that does a great job of explaining the inner workings of 
neural networks, with historical context that helps make details more intuitive

## Stanford course CS231n, "CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition"  
<https://cs231n.github.io/>
includes a nice walkthrough of how backpropagation works: https://cs231n.github.io/optimization-2/
  
## Deep Learning book
https://www.deeplearningbook.org/
Textbook from three researchers who helped usher in the deep learning era.
Good source of references on why things are done the way they're done.
